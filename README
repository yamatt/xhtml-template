This repo allows you to quickly create a starting point for making a website.

To get started clone this directory to the directory you want. For example:
 git clone http://github.com/yamatt/xhtml-template.git new-site
 
This will give you all the files you need to get started in the new-site directory.

You will need to run download-frameworks.sh first to download the latest version of jquery. This will become more advanced in future.
